title: Polkadot XCMP MMD — Minimal POC
---

Forum background: [XCMP Design Discussion (Polkadot)](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/xcmp-design-discussion/7328).

---

## Problem and motivation

**HRMP** stores message payloads on the relay chain, which is expensive (storage + execution).

**XCMP (MMD approach)** replaces that with:

- payloads kept off the relay chain
- messages proven by **nested Merkle proofs** anchored to relay commitments

---

## How MMD XCMP replaces HRMP (conceptually)

HRMP:

- relay is a **payload mailbox** (`HrmpChannelContents`)
- receiver reads relay state proofs + prunes via watermarks

MMD XCMP:

- relay is a **commitment anchor** (no payload storage)
- receiver accepts **payload + proof bundle**, verifies it, then executes the XCM.

Minimal POC semantics:

- **unordered**: messages can arrive in any order
- **best-effort**: if nobody submits the proof bundle, nothing happens
- **no pruning**: of message stores / MMRs
- **no receipts/acks**
- **no Incentive mechanism for relayers**
- **replay protection required**: prevent executing the same proven message repeatedly

---

## POC Spec (high level)

This is the minimal spec that the implementation follows.

### POC design revamp (vs forum MMD)

- The forum sketch uses **one `XcmpMessageMMR` per channel** plus an **`XcmpChannelTree`** over those roots.
  This POC drops that split: a **single global append-only `XcmpOutboxMmr`** commits all outbound pages, and
  the parachain header digest carries only **`XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`**.
- The outbox is **one accumulator across all blocks**: leaves only append, and `mmr_leaf_index` is globally
  monotonic. We do **not** use a per-block Merkle snapshot as the primary commitment.

### Must-haves (even for minimal POC)

- **Replay protection:** `seen((source, mmr_leaf_index))`.
- **Hard bounds**:
  - max messages per call: `MaxMessagesPerCall = 4`
  - max payload size: `MaxPayloadBytes = 256 * 1024` (256 KiB)
  - **relay `Mmr::RootHash` (option A only)**: extra `StorageProof` bytes in the extrinsic — bound trie nodes the same way as other relay reads (often small next to the relay MMR leaf proof).
  - relay MMR proof: exactly 1 leaf, max proof items `MaxRelayMmrProofItems = 128` (raise for devnets if you expect **deep** historical leaves; proof width grows with relay progress)
  - para-heads Merkle proof: max proof items `MaxParaHeadsProofItems = 32`
  - outbox MMR proof: exactly 1 leaf, max proof items `MaxOutboxMmrProofItems = 64`
  - implied max total bytes per call: `MaxTotalCallBytes ≈ 768 * 1024` (768 KiB) via the above bounds
- **Deterministic source commitment**
  - During **source** block execution, the outbox must **`deposit_log`** the digest so that **`XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`** is part of the **final parachain header** for that block. The relay’s **`ParaHeadsRoot`** is computed over **`SCALE((para_id, head_bytes))`** where **`head_bytes`** is exactly that encoded header—so the commitment is binding once the source block is included on the relay. PVF / validators must agree on the same header bytes (same digest list, same root).

### Current Beefy-(MMR) implementation on the relay chain that we rely on

Relay chain runtimes configure `pallet_beefy_mmr::LeafExtra = H256` and set:

- `LeafExtra = ParaHeadsRoot`
- `ParaHeadsRootProvider` computes Merkle root over `sorted_para_heads()`
  - `(para_id_u32, head_bytes)` sorted by id

**Important**: this defines the proof format and hashing. Our verifier must match it exactly.

### “Matryoshka” proof stack (minimal POC variant, simplified)

#### Smallest → largest commitments

1. **`XcmpOutboxMmr`** (source chain, global, append-only): each drained outbound page becomes one leaf
   containing `(dest_para_id, payload_hash)`, where `payload_hash = Keccak256(page_bytes)`. The global
   `mmr_leaf_index` is the only monotonic identifier (“nonce”).
2. **Source parachain header**: the header digest commits the rolling **`XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`** (bagged MMR root after the block’s appends; empty blocks carry-forward the last root).
3. **`ParaHeadsRoot`** (relay snapshot): a chosen relay MMR leaf exposes `leaf_extra = ParaHeadsRoot`, a
   binary Merkle root over `SCALE((para_id_u32, head_bytes))` entries (sorted by `para_id`). The relevant
   entry includes the source `head_bytes` whose digest contains the `xmmd` item carrying `XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`.
4. **Relay MMR root** (implicit root anchor): the **relay-parent state trie root** already carried in
   destination `PersistedValidationData` as **`relay_parent_storage_root`**. Under that root, the relay
   runtime stores the current MMR root in **`pallet_mmr::RootHash`** (same value BEEFY logs as
   `ConsensusLog::MmrRoot` for that block). **Two supported ways to obtain `mmr_root` in the verifier**
   (pick one; Appendix A):
   - **Option A — relayer `StorageProof`:** the relayer includes a proof for `Mmr::RootHash` in
     `submit_xcmp_mmd` (no collator / inherent changes).
   - **Option B — collator relay proof extension:** the destination runtime implements
     **`KeyToIncludeInRelayProof`** so the collator merges the `Mmr::RootHash` key into the same inherent
     relay proof already stored as **`ParachainSystem::RelayStateProof`**; the inbox pallet reconstructs
     `RelayChainStateProof` and **reads** the value (small runtime change; **no** extra proof in the
     extrinsic).  
   In both cases the value is decoded from the verified trie — **no** relay header bytes and **no**
   explicit `relay_mmr_root` scalar in calldata. Because the relay MMR is append-only, **historical**
   relay leaves still verify under **later** `RootHash` values once you have a wide enough `LeafProof`.

#### Destination verifies nested proofs

1. Obtain **`mmr_root`** = **`Mmr::RootHash`** read under **`ValidationData.relay_parent_storage_root`**
   (**Option A:** verify `relay_mmr_root_proof` in the extrinsic; **Option B:** read from
   `RelayChainStateProof` rebuilt from `RelayStateProof` + `ValidationData` — Appendix A). Same trie /
   hasher stack as Cumulus `RelayChainStateProof::new`.
2. Verify a single relay MMR leaf proof at **`relay_mmr_leaf_index`** against **`mmr_root`**, then decode the
   leaf to obtain `leaf_extra = ParaHeadsRoot`.
3. Verify **`binary_merkle_tree::MerkleProof`** for `SCALE((source, head_bytes))` against `ParaHeadsRoot`.
4. Decode **`head_bytes`** as the source parachain **header**, then read **`DigestItem::PreRuntime(*b"xmmd", …)`** → **`XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`**.
5. Verify **outbox MMR leaf proof** (single leaf) for leaf **`(dest, payload_hash)`** at **`mmr_leaf_index`** against **`XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`**.
6. Check **`Keccak256(payload) == payload_hash`** (relayer supplies bytes).
7. Replay protection: reject if **`seen((source, mmr_leaf_index))`**.
8. POC execution: emit event / enqueue bytes / XCM execution

---

## POC Implementation (low level)

#### Commitments, identifiers, and proof types (concrete)

- **Outbox accumulator**: one global append-only `XcmpOutboxMmr`
- **OutboxLeaf**: `(dest: u32, payload_hash: H256)` (SCALE-encoded)
- **Outbox leaf index / “nonce”**: `mmr_leaf_index: u64` (global monotonic; not stored in the leaf)
- **Header digest (source header)**: `DigestItem::PreRuntime(*b"xmmd", SCALE((version, XcmpOutboxMmrRoot)))`
- **Empty blocks**: carry-forward last root (repeat previous `XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`)

- `SourceParaId`, `DestParaId`: `u32` (SCALE where needed)
- **`relay_mmr_leaf_index`**: relay `pallet_mmr` leaf index whose relay MMR leaf carries the `ParaHeadsRoot`
  you prove against (must match the sole leaf index in the relay `LeafProof`)
- **Routing**: implicit in `(dest, payload_hash)`; no channel tree

- **Hashing**:
  - `payload_hash = Keccak256(payload_bytes)` where `payload_bytes` is the exact `Vec<u8>` drained from `XcmpQueue::take_outbound_messages`
  - Para-heads Merkle must match relay: `H = Keccak256`, leaf `SCALE((para_id_u32, head_bytes))`, relay sorts by `para_id`, per `binary_merkle_tree` (`substrate/utils/binary-merkle-tree`)

- **Proof types**:
  - **Relay `RootHash` (Option A):** `sp_trie::StorageProof` proving **`pallet_mmr::RootHash`** at the relay
    trie rooted at **`relay_parent_storage_root`**. Decode **`mmr_root`** from the verified trie (no
    separate `relay_mmr_root: H256` unless you want a redundant witness).
  - **Relay `RootHash` (Option B):** no extra extrinsic field — value comes from the **inherent** relay
    proof already stored in **`ParachainSystem::RelayStateProof`**, after the collator merged the key via
    **`KeyToIncludeInRelayProof`** (Appendix A).
  - **Para-heads proof**: `binary_merkle_tree::MerkleProof<H256, Vec<u8>>` where `leaf = SCALE((source_u32, head_bytes))`
  - **Relay MMR proof (single leaf)**: `sp_mmr_primitives::EncodableOpaqueLeaf` + `sp_mmr_primitives::LeafProof<H256>` (exactly 1 leaf; proof’s sole `leaf_indices[0]` must equal `relay_mmr_leaf_index`)
  - **Outbox MMR proof (single leaf)**: `sp_mmr_primitives::EncodableOpaqueLeaf` + `sp_mmr_primitives::LeafProof<H256>` (exactly 1 leaf; proof’s sole `leaf_indices[0]` must equal `mmr_leaf_index`), verified statelessly against `XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`

- **`MessageWithProof`**:  
  - **Option A:** `{ source, dest, mmr_leaf_index, relay_mmr_leaf_index, payload, relay_mmr_root_proof, relay_mmr_proof, para_heads_proof, outbox_mmr_proof }`  
  - **Option B:** omit **`relay_mmr_root_proof`** (same other fields).  
  (Naming is up to you; Option B implies a compile-time or runtime flag so the extrinsic codec matches.)

### Source: XcmpMmdOutbox Pallet 

#### How to integrate with the current XcmpQueue

- Hook point: `ParachainSystem::on_finalize` drains `OutboundXcmpMessageSource::take_outbound_messages`
  (typically `XcmpQueue`), yielding `Vec<(ParaId, Vec<u8>)>`.
- Runtime wiring: set `type OutboundXcmpMessageSource = XcmpMmdOutbox` so the wrapper can observe the drained
  bytes.
- Wrapper behavior (per `(dest, data)`):
  - `payload_hash = Keccak256(data)`
  - append one outbox leaf `(dest, payload_hash)` to the global MMR (this defines `mmr_leaf_index`)
- Finalize: compute bagged `XcmpOutboxMmrRoot` and `deposit_log(DigestItem::PreRuntime(*b"xmmd", ...))`.

#### One-block dataflow

```text
ParachainSystem::on_finalize
  └─ take_outbound_messages (wrapper)
       ├─ XcmpQueue::take_outbound_messages
       └─ for each (dest, data): note_outbound → push leaf on XcmpOutboxMmr

XcmpMmdOutbox::on_finalize   // after ParachainSystem
  └─ XcmpOutboxMmrRoot = bag_peaks (current MMR root)
  └─ deposit_log(PreRuntime, (version, XcmpOutboxMmrRoot))
```

**Critical:** in **`construct_runtime!`**, place **`XcmpMmdOutbox` after `ParachainSystem`**.

### Destination: XcmpMmdInbox Pallet 

#### Submission model: permissionless extrinsic

Anyone can be a relayer. The destination chain exposes an extrinsic, e.g.:

- `submit_xcmp_mmd(messages: Vec<MessageWithProof>)`

- **Option A:** no collator / inherent changes — the relayer carries the extra relay trie proof.
- **Option B:** small **destination-runtime** change — implement **`KeyToIncludeInRelayProof`** so the
  collator merges **`Mmr::RootHash`** into the mandatory relay proof, plus a **`RelayChainStateProof`**
  helper (e.g. `read_mmr_root_hash()`) used by the inbox pallet. **No** `relay_mmr_root_proof` in the
  extrinsic.

#### What the extrinsic must carry (per message)

- `source: u32`, `dest: u32`
- `mmr_leaf_index: u64` (outbox MMR leaf index / nonce)
- `relay_mmr_leaf_index: u64` (relay MMR leaf index that supplies `leaf_extra = ParaHeadsRoot`)
- `payload: Vec<u8>` (bounded)
- **`relay_mmr_root_proof` (Option A only):** relay-chain **`StorageProof`** for **`pallet_mmr::RootHash`**,
  verified against **`ValidationData.relay_parent_storage_root`** (Appendix A).
- `relay_mmr_proof` (single leaf at `relay_mmr_leaf_index`, verified against **`mmr_root`** from Option A or B)
- `para_heads_proof` (leaf `SCALE((source_u32, head_bytes))`)
- `outbox_mmr_proof` (single leaf at `mmr_leaf_index`, under `XcmpOutboxMmrRoot` from `head_bytes`)

#### Off-chain relayer tool

- For each source message:
  - fetch `payload` bytes (see below) and compute `payload_hash`
  - choose `relay_mmr_leaf_index` whose `ParaHeadsRoot` contains the exact `(source, head_bytes)`
  - **Option A:** at the **destination’s relay parent**, build a relay **`StorageProof`** that includes the
    key for **`Mmr::RootHash`** (can merge trie nodes with other reads in one blob).
  - generate proofs: `relay_mmr_proof`, `para_heads_proof`, `outbox_mmr_proof`, and **if Option A** also
    `relay_mmr_root_proof`
  - submit `MessageWithProof` to destination

#### Where the relayer gets the full `payload` (XCM bytes)

**On-chain we only commit `payload_hash`.** The **verifier** checks that submitted **`Vec<u8>`** matches that hash; it does **not** reconstruct the message from the chain.

The **relayer** obtains the **original page bytes** from a **data-availability path**, for example:

- **Source parachain archival state (recommended for POC):** fetch the drained outbound bytes from the
  **source parachain’s state at the committed block** (archive node / historical state RPC). In today’s
  Cumulus flow, `ParachainSystem::on_finalize` drains `take_outbound_messages` and stores outbound HRMP
  messages for PVF; an archive node can read that storage (e.g. `HrmpOutboundMessages` in
  `cumulus/pallets/parachain-system`) at the source block hash and recover the exact `Vec<u8>` page bytes
  that were hashed into `payload_hash`.
**Cryptographic binding is on-chain; bytes are a data-availability problem.** This POC assumes some off-chain publication/custody path exists for the committed bytes.

#### How the relayer generates the outbox MMR proof

To submit `outbox_mmr_proof` for a historical `mmr_leaf_index`, the relayer needs a way to obtain a
single-leaf `sp_mmr_primitives::LeafProof<H256>` against the `XcmpOutboxMmrRoot` committed in the source
header.

**Preferred (POC-friendly):** expose a **runtime API** that returns the outbox leaf + proof at a given block:

- Input: `{ at: source_block_hash, mmr_leaf_index }`
- Output: `{ outbox_leaf: (dest, payload_hash), outbox_leaf_proof: LeafProof<H256> }`

The relayer calls this against a full/archive source node (historical state), then submits that proof
bundle to the destination.

**Storage implication:** the source chain must retain enough MMR node/peak data to build proofs for the
desired history range. For a minimal POC this can be **no pruning**; a production design can use a bounded
window (older proofs become unavailable unless material is retained elsewhere).

#### Verification (canonical algorithm)
1. Resolve **`mmr_root`**:  
   - **Option A:** from `ValidationData.relay_parent_storage_root` + **`relay_mmr_root_proof`** (mirror
     `RelayChainStateProof::new`, then read **`Mmr::RootHash`**).  
   - **Option B:** `RelayChainStateProof::new(SelfParaId, relay_parent_storage_root, RelayStateProof::get())`
     then **`read_mmr_root_hash()`** (or equivalent) — the inherent already proved this key if the runtime
     listed it in **`KeyToIncludeInRelayProof::keys_to_prove()`**.
2. Verify the submitted **relay MMR leaf proof** (single leaf) **at `relay_mmr_leaf_index`** against **`mmr_root`**; decode the proven leaf and read `leaf_extra = ParaHeadsRoot` (**snapshot for that relay leaf**, not “whatever the tip says today”).
3. Verify the submitted **para-heads Merkle proof** against that `ParaHeadsRoot` and decode its leaf as `SCALE((source_u32, head_bytes))`.
4. Decode `head_bytes` as the source parachain header → extract **`XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`** digest item (`engine_id = *b"xmmd"`).
5. Verify the submitted **outbox MMR proof** (single leaf) for outbox leaf `(dest, payload_hash)` at `mmr_leaf_index` against `XcmpOutboxMmrRoot`.
6. Check `Keccak256(payload) == payload_hash`.
7. Replay protection: `seen((source, mmr_leaf_index))` must be false; then mark it seen.
8. **Post-verify:** destination execution — feed those bytes into the destination runtime’s **normal inbound XCMP dispatch path** with the correct **sender origin** (`ParaId::from(source)` / `Sibling(ParaId)`), typically by invoking the configured **`XcmpMessageHandler`** (in Cumulus templates this is usually **`XcmpQueue`**) using whatever **internal hook / helper** your runtime exposes for “append sibling message bytes”.


#### Minimal verifier guards

- Reject unless `dest == SelfParaId`.
- Reject unless `relay_mmr_proof.leaf_indices[0] == relay_mmr_leaf_index` and
  `outbox_mmr_proof.leaf_indices[0] == mmr_leaf_index` (single-leaf POC).
- After decoding the proven outbox leaf, `ensure!(leaf.dest == dest && leaf.payload_hash == Keccak256(payload))`.

## Appendix A: Relay MMR root (trustless anchor on the destination)

### What the parachain already knows

`set_validation_data` stores relay `PersistedValidationData`, including:

- **`relay_parent_storage_root`** — the relay **state trie root** after executing the relay parent block
- **`relay_parent_number`**

and persists the relay trie proof bytes as **`ParachainSystem::RelayStateProof`** (already verified in
`set_validation_data` via `RelayChainStateProof::new` against that root).

That storage root is the trust anchor for **any** relay-chain storage read proven inside the parachain
runtime (same pattern as Cumulus `RelayChainStateProof`, which builds a `TrieBackend` with
`HashingFor<RelayBlock>` at `relay_parent_storage_root`).

### Where `mmr_root` lives on the relay chain

`pallet_mmr` persists the latest MMR root as a normal storage value **`RootHash`**, updated as part of
block execution. Rococo-style Polkadot SDK relay runtimes also wire
`pallet_mmr::Config::OnNewRoot = pallet_beefy_mmr::DepositBeefyDigest`, which logs the **same** root into
the relay header as `ConsensusLog::MmrRoot` — useful for light clients, **but the parachain POC verifier
should not depend on a user-supplied relay header digest** (that digest is not bound by
`relay_parent_storage_root` alone).

### Storage key (must match the relay runtime)

FRAME’s fixed 32-byte prefix for a storage value is:

`concat(twox_128(pallet_name), twox_128(storage_item_name))`

So for `pallet_mmr::RootHash` you need the **exact** `pallet_name` bytes from the relay’s
`construct_runtime!` (e.g. **`Mmr`** next to `pallet_mmr` on Rococo), and **`RootHash`** as the item name.
If the relay renames the pallet, uses a second MMR instance, or you target another relay flavor without
`pallet_mmr`, the key changes or the read does not exist — **hard-code / generate the key against the
relay runtime you support.**

### Option A — relayer carries `relay_mmr_root_proof` (no collator change)

- **`relay_mmr_root_proof`**: a `StorageProof` whose trie nodes, together with
  `ValidationData.relay_parent_storage_root`, allow reading **`Mmr::RootHash`**. Decode the value as the
  relay’s MMR root hash (`H256` / `MmrRootHash`) → **`mmr_root`**.
- **No** separate `relay_mmr_root` argument is required: the value is **determined** by relay state once the
  proof verifies.

### Option B — collator merges the key (`KeyToIncludeInRelayProof`)

Cumulus merges **`KeyToIncludeInRelayProof::keys_to_prove()`** into the same relay proof the collator puts in
the inherent (`cumulus/client/parachain-inherent` → `collect_relay_storage_proof`). Your **destination**
runtime returns e.g. `RelayStorageKey::Top(mmr_root_key_bytes)` alongside the static HRMP/DMQ keys.

Reference pattern (test runtime): `cumulus/test/runtime/src/lib.rs` — `impl KeyToIncludeInRelayProof for Runtime { fn keys_to_prove() -> RelayProofRequest { … } }`. The SDK parachain **template** currently returns
`Default::default()` (no extra keys) until you add them.

Then the inbox pallet does **`RelayChainStateProof::new(para_id, relay_parent_storage_root, RelayStateProof::<T>::get())?`**
and a small helper (**not** in Cumulus today — you add it) such as **`read_mmr_root_hash()`** that reads the
key from the verified trie. **Extrinsic:** omit **`relay_mmr_root_proof`**; proof size per block grows slightly
for **this** parachain only (unlike extending Cumulus’ global static key list, which would affect everyone).

**Requirement:** `keys_to_prove()` must list the **`Mmr::RootHash`** key for every relay runtime / pallet
name you support. If the collator omits it, the merged proof has no leaf for that key →
**`read_mmr_root_hash()`** fails and **`submit_xcmp_mmd`** must reject (fail closed). Today’s
`ParachainSystem` inherent does not read this key itself, so the block can still be built; the bug surfaces
at your verifier unless you add an explicit inherent-time check.

### After `mmr_root`

Verify **`relay_mmr_proof`** (single leaf) against **`mmr_root`**, decode `leaf_extra = ParaHeadsRoot`, and
continue the stack as in the main body.

### Historical relay leaves

`RootHash` at the relay parent is the MMR root **after** that relay block’s MMR update; it commits to **all**
prior relay leaves. Proving an **earlier** relay leaf under that root is the usual append-only MMR story
(wider `LeafProof` when the leaf is old). You still need an **archive-quality** relay view (or deep enough
MMR proof material) to **construct** those proofs off-chain.

## Appendix B: Where HRMP flows today

- `cumulus/pallets/parachain-system/src/lib.rs` — `on_finalize` drains `take_outbound_messages`, stores `HrmpOutboundMessages`.
- `cumulus/pallets/parachain-system/src/validate_block/implementation.rs` — PVF reads `HrmpOutboundMessages` → `ValidationResult.horizontal_messages`.
- `polkadot/runtime/parachains/src/inclusion/mod.rs` — `hrmp::prune_hrmp`, `queue_outbound_hrmp`.
